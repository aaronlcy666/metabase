## Working with Google BigQuery in Metabase

**Starting in v0.15.0**, Metabase provides a driver for connecting to BigQuery directly and executing queries against any datasets you have.  

**Starting in v0.36.0**, Metabase allows you to connect to your BigQuery dataset using a [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts).

The below sections provide information on how to get connected and troubleshoot any issues that may come up.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account with a [Project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects) you would like to use in Metabase. Consult the Google Cloud Platform documentation for how to [create and manage a project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

## Connecting to a BigQuery Dataset

### For new connections
To connect a BigQuery dataset, select **Admin** from the settings icon. In the **Setup** section, under **GET CONNECTED**, click on **Add a Database**.

From the first dropdown, **Database Type**, select **BigQuery**. Metabase will present you with the relevant configuration fields to fill out:

![images](../images/bigquery_add_database.png)

#### Fields

##### Name

##### Dataset ID

##### Service Account JSON file

#### Sliders

##### Use the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) timezone

We suggest you leave this off unless you're doing manual timezone casting in many or most of your queries with this data.

##### Automatically run queries when doing simple filtering and summarizing.

When this is on, Metabase will automatically run queries when users do simple explorations with the Summarize and Filter buttons when viewing a table or chart. You can turn this off if querying this database is slow. This setting doesnâ€™t affect drill-throughs or SQL queries.

##### This is a large datbase, so let me choose when Metabase syncs and scans

By default, Metabase does a lightweight hourly sync and an intensive daily scan of field values. If you have a large database, we recommend turning this on and reviewing when and how often the field value scans happen.

#### Save your database configuration

When you're done, click the save button.

### For legacy connections
* Start by giving this connection a __Name__ and providing your Google Cloud Platform __Project ID__ along with your desired BigQuery __Dataset ID__.  If you don't have a dataset and want to play around with something we recommend copying one of the [sample tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sample-tables)
![Basic Fields](../images/bigquery_basic.png)
* Follow the `Click here` link provided below the __Client ID__ field which will open a new browser tab and guide you through the process of generating OAuth 2.0 credentials for Metabase.  Make sure to choose `Other` for your application type.
![Client ID](../images/bigquery_clientid.png)
* take the resulting client ID and client secret and copy them over to Metabase.
![Client Details](../images/bigquery_clientdetails.png)
* Now follow the link below the __Auth Code__ field for `Click here to get an auth code` which will open a new browser window and authorize your credentials for a BigQuery access token to use the api.  Simply click the `Allow` button.
![Generating an Auth Code](../images/bigquery_authcode.png)
* Copy the resulting code provided into the __Auth Code__ field in Metabase.
![Copying the Auth Code](../images/bigquery_copycode.png)
* Click the `Save` button!

Metabase will now begin inspecting your BigQuery Dataset and finding any tables and fields to build up a sense for the schema.  Give it a little bit of time to do its work and then you're all set to start querying.


## Using Legacy SQL

As of version 0.30.0, Metabase tells BigQuery to interpret SQL queries as [Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/). If you prefer using [Legacy SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql) instead, you can tell Metabase to do so by including a `#legacySQL` directive at the beginning of your query, for example:

```sql
#legacySQL
SELECT *
FROM [my_dataset.my_table]
```
